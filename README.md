Not a project, just to be clear, this is a collection of stuff I did in school. I dislike WinForms, but I don't have control over that, at least some things were done in python.

If you're in my class as this line is here, maybe don't copy anything from here verbatim.

I don't have anything from 10th saved, but at least I have 11th and 12th.
Everything is sorted by year, then units, into the different assignments.

The one thing in here that was not assigned schoolwork is TestOpCodes, at first a CIL/OpCode testbed, but now it just decompiles .exe's.
